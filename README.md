karmaMusical3DStructure
=======================

An Ofx sketch that loads a 3D file and renders it with edges animated according to a music input analysed with an FFT.  

This project could also be a good start for manipulating 3D objects as it collects vertexes, vertices and normals from imported 3D objects.
